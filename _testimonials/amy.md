This guy is worth every penny. We had a nasty leak caused by a bad foundation in our roof. Other companies told me my damaged roof would cost at least twenty thousand dollars to fix, maybe more. In my desperation I tried to get one more estimate from Usaf, not only did he give me multiple options at different prices, but his most expensive option was around seventeen thousand dollars. We couldn't be happier with our new roof. We love you Usaf.
