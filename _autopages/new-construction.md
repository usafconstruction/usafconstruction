## From Inception to Construction

Whether you want to draw it yourself, or use Usaf's extensive new construction experience. We'll help you make your dream house come true from inception to contruction. I'll personally work with you on a timeline, and make sure you check off on every process of the plan. We'll design the blueprints together and I'll keep you in the loop every step of the way 

## We work through Michigan winters

We know timelines are important, but we also know the value of hard work and keeping it one hundred in the winter time. We advise you to start the process in winter, that way we can get through the blueprinting and digging while its snowing outside. That way everything is ready to go by spring time.

## From brick to panel, we do it all

Whatever your budget is. You can count on me to provide you the right service that fits your wants and your budget. We'll explore the options together and draw up a game plan. That's the advantage of working with Usaf, it all goes through me, the owner and chief architecht.
