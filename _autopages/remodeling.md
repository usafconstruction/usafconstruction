## Home remodeling 

Remodeling your home can be a daunting task. Homes in south east Michigan are built to last, and the last thing you want to do is to bring someone in that messes your foundation. When you contract Usaf to work on your home, you get just that, Usaf himself. For better or worse, you don't go through any salesmen or secretaries, all your communications are directly with me, the crew chief.

## Business renovation

Rennovating your business is one of the easy ways to increase foot traffic to your store. But don't just take my word for it. Go check out my work at Good Burger in Dearborn. They had a very specific idea of what they wanted, a "Five Guys" clone, so I obliged. Let me know what your vision is and I will make happen.
