USAF Construction and Roofing LLC. is a lean construction company with me Usaf handling all back office operation and crew management and Jerry my business partner handling on site operations.

I've come to this country as an immigrant and getting naturalized was the second happiest day of my life. I'm immensely proud of this company. We are proud of every brick we lay, we work hard and we take a lot of pride in doing things right and doing right by our customers. 

We're coming into our fifth years of business and our projects can be seen all over south east Michigan. When you need to call the construction professionals in metro Detroit, think Usaf construction and roofing first.
